Generates a EPUB for the Google SRE Book.

Original sources are downloaded from https://landing.google.com/sre/

Review and run the `bootstrap.sh` script to generate the EPUB.

**Note**: Currently relies on python2 and pip to install dependencies
and does not setup a virtualenv. Please review the script and edit
as per your needs. If you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/)
installed, it will set up the virtualenv for you after you run
`direnv allow`.
